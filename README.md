# Hobo
## A text based game for the modern vagrant.

Hobo is a sequel to the widely loved Hobo Encampment game.  It incorporates an updated rendering system complete with color and realtime input, as well as a flexible map simulation system that allows for a living breathing world.
Hobo comes tightly coupled with a generic ASCII game engine written in Python that provides map interactions, input handling, and a functional approach to world updates.

### Rules
The goal in Hobo is to survive and thrive.  Start by making it to water, keeping your health up, then building a network of paths and shelters.  Connect to the outside world and let your community transform the forest into a city.

Time in Hobo is tracked in turns.  A turn passes when you spend time traversing terrain or taking an action.  Terrain that is harder to traverse takes more turns, but your deer trail through it makes future traversals faster and provides you with resources.
Using logs, you can build permanent paths that take no turns to traverse.  These can be built as bridges over water as well, for more materials.

You lose health by taking a turn with negative food or water.  You can replenish food by interacting with berries, water by interacting with water, and health by interacting with a shelter.
